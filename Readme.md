Ansible supports two types of inventory variables Host Variables and Group Variables. 
Host Variables:
Host variables are applied to specific host for which the variable is declared. 
Group Variables:
On the other hand, Group Variables are applied to a group of hosts


Ansible Roles:
Roles provide a framework for fully independent, or interdependent collections of variables, tasks, files, templates, and modules.

In Ansible, the role is the primary mechanism for breaking a playbook into multiple files. This simplifies writing complex playbooks, and it makes them easier to reuse. The breaking of playbook allows you to logically break the playbook into reusable components.
